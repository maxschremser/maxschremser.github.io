Today I have read about [JSR296](//www.jgoodies.com/download/presentations/jsr296.pdf) the **Swing App Framework** by *Karsten Lentzsch*.

It inspired me to create a Java Swing Desktop Application. I wanted to use the Java Spring Framework for simplicity of 
property reading for the JFrame. Today I tried [yo](//github.com/yeoman/yo)'s 
**java-gradle generator**. **Yo** is the CLI tool for running Yeoman generators. 
Yeoman helps you to kickstart new projects, read more about it [here](//yeoman.io).
 
### Prerequisites

1. Install **Gradle**
 ```
 brew install gradle
 ```
 
2. Install **Npm**
```
brew install npm
```

3. Install **yo**
```
npm install -g yo
```

4. Start **yo** and search for **java-gradle** 
```
yo
```

5. Create a new project directory **swing-spring**
```
mkdir swing-spring && cd swing-spring
```

6. Create a new sample **Java Project** and follow the instructions
```
yo java-gradle
```

### Project Configuration
Having now a basic Java Project with Gradle integration I opened my **Project From Existing Sources...** in IntelliJ and
added *spring integration core* as a compile dependency in the projects *build.gradle* file:

{% highlight java %}

    compile "org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-core:4.2.1.RELEASE"

{% endhighlight %}


### Creating the JFrame
I wanted to use annotation based spring initialization to avoid unnecessary resource configuration files.

The Main class is *com.schremser.swing.spring.Launcher* which initializes the Spring Beans using an 
*AnnotationConfigApplicationContext*. Add the Main class as *mainClassName* property to your *build.gradle* file to
make it startable via gradle.
{% highlight java%}
mainClassName = 'com.schremser.swing.spring.Launcher'
{% endhighlight %}

The Launcher class scans the SpringContext Configuration for Factory Beans to create.
